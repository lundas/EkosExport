# EkosExport

## About the Project
Ekos (https://www.goekos.com/) is a web-based Enterprise Resource Planning \(ERP\)
software used by craft beverage makers to streamline inventory, production, sales,
and accounting.

Though Ekos is a favorite among many craft breweries for its user-friendly production UI, its lack of API endpoints 
and webhook functionality creates substantial difficulties when trying to integrate it into a modern 
technology stack.

This module is an attempt to circumvent these bottlenecks by using the Python Web Bindings for
Selenium in order to automate tasks within Ekos, thus creating the programmatic interface necessary
for integration with other systems that would ordinarily be handled by an API.
